This is a simple ruby script that allows users to encrypt a word or phrase using the MD5, SHA1, or SHA2 encryption methods.

Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine
Run the script by typing ruby main.rb in the command line
Enter a word or phrase to encrypt
Select an encryption method (1. MD5, 2. SHA1, 3. SHA2)
The script will output the encrypted result.
Note

Please note that the script uses the digest library to perform the encryption and it is recommended to use a more secure encryption method for sensitive information. The encryption methods used in this script are primarily for demonstration purposes.
